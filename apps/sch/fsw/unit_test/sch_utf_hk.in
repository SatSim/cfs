; Purpose: 
;   This is the command input file used to unit test the 
;   CFS Scheduler (SCH) Application.
;
;   This file is used in conjunction with the utf_test_mm.c
;   unit test driver and handles high level testing of command 
;   processing through the SCH application's software bus pipe.
; 
;   These tests assume the following Message and Command ID
;   settings in the SCH code:
;
;    SCH_CMD_MID      = 0x1895    
;    SCH_SEND_HK_MID  = 0x1896
