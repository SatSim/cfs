<h1><a class="anchor" name="cfsschopr">CFS Scheduler Operation</a></h1>The SCH Application has an operational interface consisting of eight commands, two tables and two different telemetry messages.<h2><a class="anchor" name="cfsschoprtbls">
SCH Tables</a></h2>
The two tables are the Schedule Definition Table (SDT) and the Message Definition Table (MDT).<p>
The tables, combined, define the behavior of the SCH Application while it is running. The SDT contains information identifying which messages are to be sent and when and the MDT contains definitions of the messages that are to be sent. Since the SDT references the contents of the MDT, it is imperative that the operator update these tables carefully to prevent unexpected and potentially disruptive behavior from the SCH Application. The simplest method to prevent these problems is to replace the default table images for these tables (the filenames are specified using the SCH platform configuration parameters <a class="el" href="sch__platform__cfg_8h.html#a0a00e5974aa67bfe91ce39d1f2db1d3">SCH_SCHEDULE_FILENAME</a> and <a class="el" href="sch__platform__cfg_8h.html#052acaa8ebd6c01b4fcc35636ea3b265">SCH_MESSAGE_FILENAME</a>) and to restart the SCH Application.<p>
The contents and structure of the tables can be found at <a class="el" href="cfsschtbl.html">CFS Scheduler Table Definitions</a>.<h2><a class="anchor" name="cfsschoprenadis">
Enable/Disable SCH Activities</a></h2>
The command interface for the SCH Application provides Enable/Disable commands for either Enabling/Disabling individual activities in the SDT or for Enabling/Disabling entire groups of activities. When the activities are defined in the SDT, they can be assigned both a Group Number and/or a Multi-Group Identifier. A group number typically identifies a single set of activities that are very closely related, if not identical. An example of a single group could be the messages used to notify Memory Dwell when to examine and log the contents of the memory addresses. A Multi-Group Identifier can be used to combine individual activities and groups of activities into a larger group. For example, one could assign individual groups to activities associated with each experiment and then combine all the experiment groups into a single Multi-Group. This allows all experiment message traffic to be suspended/restarted with a single command.<h2><a class="anchor" name="cfsschoprdiag">
SCH Diagnostic Packet</a></h2>
If the operator wishes to know the current configuration of the activities defined by the SDT and the MDT without dumping the tables and analyzing their contents, they have the <a class="el" href="sch__msgdefs_8h.html#88063e9eba628a369ecfeafb22867287">Send Diagnostic Packet </a> command at their disposal. This command forces the generation of an SCH Diagnostic Packet that contains the current state (Enabled/Disabled) of each activity in the SDT and also indicates the Message IDs associated with each activity in the table.<h2><a class="anchor" name="cfsschoprnoop">
Command Interface Verification and SCH Application Version Information</a></h2>
The command interface also includes a <a class="el" href="sch__msgdefs_8h.html#ff13c67ad0852d59ca4ef44879566f57">SCH No-op command </a>. This command is useful for verifying that the command interface to the SCH Application is working. It also causes an <a class="el" href="sch__events_8h.html#333ecd3c41dbc9990b080c681cc4466f">Event Message </a> to be generated that contains the SCH Application's version information. It should also be noted that the version information can also be obtained when the Application starts up. After SCH has successfully initialized itself, an <a class="el" href="sch__events_8h.html#2143003d800956b0a42acb189559dc97">Event Message </a> is generated that indicates successful initialization and also includes the Application's version information. Both of these event messages are 'Informational' and are NOT filtered by default.<h2><a class="anchor" name="cfsschoprmfsync">
Major Frame Synchronization</a></h2>
The SCH Application requires a stable Major Frame Synchronization signal (typically a 1Hz signal) to maintain a reliable performance of the activities defined in the SDT. If the Major Frame Synchronization signal is determined to be too noisy (i.e. - Occurs outside the expected window, see <a class="el" href="sch__platform__cfg_8h.html#fa493b73d6d26f4171bce55904f7989e">SCH_SYNC_SLOT_DRIFT_WINDOW</a>, for two consecutive major frames), then the signal is automatically ignored and the SCH Application continues to run off of the Minor Frame Synchronization signal. Once an operator has determined that the Major Frame Synchronization signal is stable, the operator can use the <a class="el" href="sch__msgdefs_8h.html#988bd1a3fd08823654b2bdf4f695c6b3">Enable Sync Command </a> to re-enable the SCH Application's alignment to the Major Frame signal.<h2><a class="anchor" name="cfsschoprhk">
SCH Housekeeping Telemetry</a></h2>
The SCH Application generates a <a class="el" href="struct_s_c_h___hk_packet__t.html">Housekeeping Telemetry Message </a> whenever scheduled to do so by the SDT. The message contains command counters (both successful and unsuccessful) that indicate whether outside commands have been received. The operator can use these telemetry points to verify the receipt and processing of commands. The operator can reset these counters using the <a class="el" href="sch__msgdefs_8h.html#debe9b4ed9ccc1528c1198cb1acd4ac8">Reset Command </a>.<p>
The SCH Housekeeping telemetry also contains statistics that are useful for monitoring the execution of the SCH Application. These statistics indicate the number of Activities performed, number of times problems have been encountered, number of times the SCH Application has detected synchronization issues, etc. Each telemetry point is discussed in detail below:<p>

This only happens when the Scheduler Application is being run on a platform that does not have an accurate timer for driving the Minor Frame signals. During initialization, the Scheduler Application attempts to allocate a hardware timer to drive the Minor Frame Signal. If the board does not have a timer with sufficient accuracy, the Scheduler Application then also uses the subseconds of the Mission Elapsed Time to help maintain timing as well as it can. This can lead to the same slot being processed more than once in a row. The Scheduler Application will try its best to compensate for this situation.<p>
